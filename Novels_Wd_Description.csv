Summary Of The Book  	The odd chapters of Kafka On The Shore depict the story of 15-year-old Kafka as he leaves his father's house in search of his sister and mother, and also to escape from an Oedipal curse. Kafka comes across numerous adventures en route until he finds space in a library in Takamatsu. The library is owned by Miss Saeki and Oshima. He spends his time reading at the library when one fine day the police come searching for him.  	The even chapters narrate Nakata's story. He works part-time as a locator of lost cats because of his uncanny talents. The search for one lost cat requires him to travel away from home. He ends up on road where he befriends a truck driver named Hoshino, who gives him a lift in his truck. Soon he becomes attached to Nakata.  	Kafka and Nakata meet each other in the novel. However, when they meet each other it is not just in the physical sense but on a metaphysical level as well. As their odysseys unravel, fishes fall from the skies, and cats talk with people. The reader can find brutal killings, but the killer and victim’s identities remain unknown. The novel has several themes central to it, like the power of music, the connection between the subconscious, mind, and soul, the strength of nature, the influence of an old prophecy. All these combine to weave a dreamlike and elegant masterpiece. The Oedipal undercurrent running in the novel makes Kafka On The Shore the equivalent of a modern Greek tragedy.  Kafka On The Shore was named amongst the top 10 books of 2005 by The New York Times. It also won the World Fantasy Award.  About Haruki Murakami  	Haruki Murakami is a best-selling Japanese author.  	Murakami’s notable works include A Wild Sheep Chase, Norwegian Wood, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, and 1Q84.  	Murakami's fiction is frequently nihilistic and surrealistic, marked with a rendition of ideals of alienation and loneliness.

220,Sita,"English, Paperback, Pattanaik Devdutt",4.5,"(2,127)"," 	Sita: An Illustrated Retelling Of The Ramayana is the Ramayana retold with the focus of the story being on Sita, Rama’s devoted and loyal wife.  Flipkart Official Review  	Retellings of epic myths are almost the in thing. Everyone is writing about them. Everyone has their version to the Mahabharata or the Ramayana. This time round though, the renowned mythologist, Devdutt Pattanaik is back with his story of Sita and the Ramayana.  	We have all grown up with a certain idea of the Ramayana and how it should be. Devdutt just makes us look closely to the humane side of it. Rama is still a man who longs for his wife and Sita is still a woman who waits for her husband. The crux of the story is that and yet it is about faith, dharma and being righteous. The illustrations with the writing make the book more intriguing and add a lot of mythical value.  	Devdutt takes the reader to a different journey across The Ramayana, which the reader will never forget. A must read this year.  Exclusive article by Devdutt Pattanaik for Flipkart Customers  	Even though Sita plays a pivotal role in the Ramayana, when you actually seek her out you realize she is but a prop, appearing and disappearing, with her marriage, her abduction, her rescue and finally her banishment. Who is she really? There are tantalizing clues in classical as well as subaltern literature and in folk traditions, but nothing else.  	And then, of course, there is the attempt of modern writers to portray her as a helpless, hapless victim, shaped both by the tragic state of women in many parts of the world and by modern political prejudices against all things religious. So you wonder if you really know Sita at all. And this enquiry made me seek Sita.  	The journey to discover Sita makes you realize that the Ramayana is not a book, as most people assume, but a vast tradition manifesting itself in written, oral and visual traditions. And for some reason, children of India have been kept away from it. Yes, we are told of the Valmiki Ramayana, but we are not told that there are several versions of this original story itself a northern version, a southern version, an eastern version, which have barely a third of the verses common between them. Then there are Sanskrit plays written by dramatists like Bhasa and Bhavabhuti where Ram is a great hero, not necessarily God. Then we find Ramayanas of the Jains, the Buddhists as well as from South East Asia, which retell the same story but with a very different emotion. From the tenth century onwards we find the Ramayana in each and every Indian language, written by several authors, in different scripts, with different styles, all deeply immersed in bhakti. It is through these regional narratives, not the Sanskrit ones really, that ideas related to love, valour, fidelity and wisdom spread to every corner of India.  	Besides songs and stories, there are also the visual narrations in the form of carvings and murals on temple walls, paintings on cloth and paper such as the Mewari and Rajasthani miniatures and Kalamkari and Patta-chitra and Chitrakathi artworks. In some of these we find Ram with a moustache, in others with a six-pack. All these amused and inspired me and I wanted to share them with the world.  	And in this storm of ideas stands steadfast the quiet Sita, very different from the fiery and vengeful Draupadi. Her silence has been taken to mean submission by those who forget she is the daughter of Janaka who was the patron of the Upanishads, the body of work that captures the essence of Vedic thought. Through her silence she conveyed her serenity and sagacity, unflustered by the restraints of culture, demands of morality and the rage of villains.  	We today are too busy wanting to be heard. We do not bother with listening. This book is written so that we listen to Sita and through her discover a uniquely Indian approach to justice, fairness and most importantly, love.  Summary Of The Book  	Ramayana is the story of Rama, the son of King Dasharatha. He was the heir to his kingdom, an empire. Yet, due to the malice prevalent in the palace, the Prince was exiled. He had to live in the forest with his wife and his younger brother for fourteen years. Rama took this step to ensure that his father’s reputation as a man who keeps his word, was not tarnished.  	One of the underlying themes of the Ramayana echoes the upholding of tradition, reputation, and the family image. The Ramayana is all about obeying the rules and laws of Dharma, and about maintaining reputation even if it means personal loss and unhappiness. According to this book, this is the key to understanding the story of Sita in the Ramayana.  	Who is Sita? She plays a prominent role in the epic, but is a very quiet and restrained character. Her husband adores her, yet he abandons her in the end because of the persistent gossip among his subjects about Sita’s fidelity. Through all her travails, Sita remains quiet, does not lose her composure, and does not vocally demand retribution, like the fiery Draupadi of the Mahabharata. Draupadi is acknowledged as a strong character, and she is. But, Sita is often viewed as meek and submissive.  	Sita’s silence is not the silence of the weak. It is the silence of the ascetic, who knows the truth, and so is patient. She knows her husband loves her, and she is indispensable to him. Moreover, she knows she is the Goddess who makes him the God, the woman who makes him the whole man.  	She was found as a baby in a furrow when Janaka ploughed a tract of land to prepare for a yagna. Thus, from the beginning, she is special and stands apart. Even when she is held captive by Ravana, she does not really fear him.  	Sita: An Illustrated Retelling Of The Ramayana explores the enigma of Sita and explains her real strength of character. It is a very interesting analysis of a woman most people might think was a weak character, who was supposed to represent the ideal of submissive womanhood. This book shows why this was not so.  About Devdutt Pattanaik  	Devdutt Pattanaik is a doctor who became a writer.  	Other books by this author include Business Sutra: A Very Indian Approach to Management, 7 Secrets of Vishnu, Jaya: An Illustrated Retelling of the Mahabharata, The Book of Ram, and Hanuman's Ramayan.  	Devdutt Pattanaik is a doctor who worked in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry for many years. Throughout his life, he has also been deeply interested in Hindu mythology, the epics, puranas and the many legends and divine tales. So, after almost fifteen years in the healthcare industry, he switched his career. He began to focus on writing about Hindu mythology and using the Hindu scriptures to teach lessons in business management. He is now the Chief Belief Officer at the Future Group.  Interview with Devdutt Pattanaik  1. The Ramayana has had a whole lot of characters. Why did you settle on Sita to tell your story?  	Though Sita plays a pivotal role in the Ramayan, she is actually in the background, merely a device to talk about Ram. It came as a surprise to me. Further, I read many new retellings and reimaging of Sita on feminist lines, and many of these were part of the ‘victim’ discourse which I felt was a unflattering portrayal of Sita; my reading of mythology had revealed a very different woman. Wanted to share it with the world.  2. Sita has always been rather off-late, spoken about in quite a feminist manner. What are your thoughts or views on it?  	Somehow these feminist retellings make her sound like a victim. A Goddess cannot be a victim. Shit happens in life. We have a choice whether to be victim or hero or avenging angel, or sage. I did not find much about Sita, the sage. A huge gap that needed to be filled.  3. Devdutt's take on Mythology  	Stories, symbols and rituals that communicate the subjective truth or beliefs of a people.  4.  What are you reading as of now?  	First draft of my next book but I won’t tell you about it.  5. How did you spin this story? Where did the idea come from?  	I always wondered what it would be like to be daughter of the legendary Janaka, patron of the Upanishads. Few talk about it. I also wondered what Sita did in those days of her captivity. Folklore has a few clues, and these excited me as no one I knew had heard these details. Also in pilgrim spots across India, the suggestion of Ram’s celibacy during exile made me wonder what if felt like for a young couple to be denied marital rights. Then the many retellings of the tale, usually commented upon by Western scholars who are not the most sensitive lot in the world owing to demands of modern academia.  People usually focus on the radical; I loved the finer nuances in the tale, the different approaches to Ahilya or Surpanakha or Hanuman or Tara. So much knowledge hidden from India’s youth. All these churned in my mind and finally turned into this retelling.  6. Do you think Sita's voice gets lost in the Ramayana? Is there anything as more focus on Ram than Sita?  	It is Ramayana – story of Ram so every other voice is secondary. But your questions suggests that she is deliberately silenced. Many authors read the epic in this way and deliberately make it sound like something it never was. Sita’s voice is the human voice. We are not always heard because we are busy hearing.  7. Sita's side of the story. We hear that a lot these days. Is there a side to Ramayana at all? According to you, should there be different perspectives to mythology?  	This side-business is a modern curse. We have Right side, Left side, male side, female side, victim side, oppressed side etc…..we miss the point of the epic by making it political to satisfy our own agendas and making the book what it is not. We see Ram as male  and Sita as female because the Western template on which our education system is based on is unable to appreciate the symbolic. We are too eager and impatient to see things at a superficial level and declare ourselves liberal.  8.

Summary Of The Book  	Deven, one of the main characters of In Custody, lives a meagre existence teaching Hindi Literature to a group of disinterested students, in a small town of Mirpore. Bored with his mundane life, as his real interest lies in Urdu Poetry, he is positively thrilled when one day, out of the blue, he is presented with the opportunity to meet one of India’s greatest Urdu poets Nur, and possibly, even interview him.  	Seeing this as a chance of a lifetime, to escape from his own ordinary life, he can not wait to meet the great Nur. Acting on the advice of his friend Murad, who is the editor of a local periodical that publishes Urdu Literature, Deven begins preparing for his meeting with the poet. He procures a second hand tape recorder that he feels would be of use in transcribing Urdu poetry written by the great Nur, and also imagines approaching the poet to write his memoirs and carry out interviews.  	However, as things rarely go as planned, the meeting turns out to be quite different from what he had expected, in fact, as he discovers, the great poet Nur is not above vulnerabilities or weaknesses, including wives that don’t get along and self-serving flatterers who seem to be taking advantage of him.  	A touching account of the gradual depletion and diminishing of our culture in the face of modernisation, as well as the complex nature of human bonding and relationships, In Custody was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for fiction in 1984, and in 1993, a film In Custody, based on the book, was produced by Merchant Ivory productions and starred Shashi Kapoor in the role of Nur.

354,The Bachelor of Arts,"English, Paperback, Narayan R. K.",4.4,(367)," The story of a young man who is upset by the failure of his first love and his journey towards maturity.  Summary Of The Book  The Bachelor Of Arts is usually considered part of a semi-autobiographical trilogy by the author. The first book in this trilogy is Swami and Friends, this book is the second, and The English Teacher is the final book.  	These are considered to be one continuous story, of the same person as a child, as an adolescent just stepping into adulthood, and the same young man in the third book, though the names of the protagonists are different in each novel.  	This story is about young Chandran, who has just graduated. He has also just fallen in love. He sees a young girl, Malathi, on the beach one day, playing with her younger sister, and is at once smitten by the girl, who is all of fifteen years old.  	He asks his parents to approach the girl’s parents with an alliance. Being the potential groom’s parents, and therefore superior, they do it in a roundabout way. Meanwhile the impatient Chandran is lost in his dreams about Malathi, quite sure that it is only a matter of time before they are united. He just wishes it would not be too long before it happens.  	But, on matching their horoscopes, his dreams are dashed. The astrologer tells the girl’s mother that marrying Chandran would be deadly for her daughter, so she vetoes the match. Heartbroken, Chandran leaves his home and parents, deciding that the worldly pleasures are no longer for him. 	He puts on the garb of a sanyasi and wanders around the country, living on alms. After a while, he gets tired of this kind of life, and decides to return back home. He is welcomed back, and his parents then convince him to marry a beautiful young girl of their choice. Thus begins the next phase of his life.  	It is a humorously written story, highlighting the passions and the weakness of youth through the character of Chandran, his infatuation with Malathi, his clumsy attempts at renunciation, and the quickness with which he agrees to marry another girl on his return.

The creation of this ageless epic is traditionally attributed to the seer Vyasa. His disciple Vaishampayana narrated it in public for the first time. King Janamejaya and numerous learned sages were present at the recital. They had gathered for a 12-year-long sacred ritual called Yajna.  	The first volume is titled The Kuru Princes of Hastinapura. Beginning with Shantanu, King Janamejaya’s ancestor and the ruler of Hastinapura, this volume narrates the various events that led to the establishment of the Kuru dynasty. It leads the story to the reign of Dhritarashtra over Hastinapura while his brother Pandu has retired to the forest with his two wives Kunti and Madri and five sons (The Pandavas).  	Upon the death of Pandu and Madri, Kunti and the Pandavas return to Hastinapura. The return of the Pandavas, and being armed with numerous skills, make the Kauravas (the 100 sons of Dhritarashtra) jealous of them. The eldest Kaurava brother, Duryodhana, plots to send the Pandavas into exile. Forewarned about his intentions, the Pandavas manage to foil his plan and escape from the trap set for them.  	Then they spend a year in disguise, and during this time, Arjuna wins the hand of Draupadi in marriage. Without knowing what Arjuna has won in  the archery match, Kunti unwittingly asks the Pandavas to share the prize. Thus, Draupadi ends up being married to all of the Pandava brothers. After their wedding, the Pandavas are invited back to Hastinapura to resume peaceful relations.  	The second volume, The Pandavas In Exile, covers events like the Rajasooya Yajna performed by the eldest Pandava Yudhisthira, and Bheema’s slaying of the notorious Jarasandha. Eventually, the Pandavas and Kauravas play a game of dice in which the Pandavas are defeated. They are forced into 13 years of exile, of which, they must spend the last year in disguise. When they return from the stipulated exile period to reclaim their share of the kingdom, their claim is denied by Duryodhana, laying the foundation for the subsequent Kurukshetra war.  	The third volume, titled On The Battlefield Of Kurukshetra, begins with the efforts of Krishna to establish a peaceful settlement between the hostile brothers. However, his attempts prove futile, and thus begins the 18-day-long Kurukshetra war.  	Mahabharata (Set Of 3 Volumes) was published in 2010 by Amar Chitra Katha Pvt. Ltd.","₹1,950"

It is 1984. The world has changed beyond recognition. History is rewritten by the victors, and there is nowhere to run. In George Orwell’s dystopian classic, Big Brother is watching you.

Summary of the Book

	Consider for a moment that all the freedom one takes for granted is stripped away. Consider how it would be to live in a world where the Government exercised totalitarian control over the past, the future and the present. In 1984, the world as we know it has ended. A superstate called Oceania stands over the remnants of the free countries of the world. It is governed by an authoritarian body known only as Big Brother. There is no escaping the eye of Big Brother, no running away from his gaze. In this world, Winston Smith leads a sad life, forming a part of the large group of citizens who are hired for a simple purpose: rewriting old newspaper articles to erase whatever Big Brother deems evil. Smith is an efficient worker, but he hates his masters. When he meets Julia, a like-minded woman, he falls in love with her. However, while Big Brother watches, there can be no freedom to love. In this world, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength.

It is 1984. The world has changed beyond recognition. History is rewritten by the victors, and there is nowhere to run. In George Orwell’s dystopian classic, Big Brother is watching you.

Summary of the Book

	Consider for a moment that all the freedom one takes for granted is stripped away. Consider how it would be to live in a world where the Government exercised totalitarian control over the past, the future and the present. In 1984, the world as we know it has ended. A superstate called Oceania stands over the remnants of the free countries of the world. It is governed by an authoritarian body known only as Big Brother. There is no escaping the eye of Big Brother, no running away from his gaze. In this world, Winston Smith leads a sad life, forming a part of the large group of citizens who are hired for a simple purpose: rewriting old newspaper articles to erase whatever Big Brother deems evil. Smith is an efficient worker, but he hates his masters. When he meets Julia, a like-minded woman, he falls in love with her. However, while Big Brother watches, there can be no freedom to love. In this world, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength.

After receiving yet another set of inadequate grades, he is expelled from the school. In an effort to 'find himself', Holden decides to head to New York City, where he heads underground. He narrates his adventures there in a 3-day flashback, which forms the basis of Salinger’s story.  	In New York City, Holden encounters a variety of experiences and adventures which bring him along on his path to self discovery. For instance, he encounters three women in their thirties, who dance and flirt with him. After observing what he assumes is a sex scene through a hotel window, Holden decides to invite a prostitute to his room.

As Holden sinks deeper and deeper into this debaucherous lifestyle, a chance meeting with his sister Phoebe supplies Holden with just enough affection to yank him out of his 'madness'.  	The frequent use of profanity and colloquialism by Salinger adds an element of realism to the characters, and is indicative of 'teenage behaviour'.

930,The Guide,"English, Paperback, Narayan R. K.",4.5,"(1,285)"," An Indian novel in English,The Guide explains the change in the character of Raju, the protagonist, from a tourist guide to a spiritual guide, and then how he becomes a deity God of India.  Summary Of The Book  The Guide, set in Malgudi, the fictitious town in South India, begins as a comedic look into the life of a rogue, but evolves into something quite different. This is the story of Raju, an ordinary middle class man in South India, who vicariously rose to the height of fame, had a plunging fall, then again rose up like the phoenix to become a swamiji, a demi-god.  	In the middle of the story is a flashback to Raju's life prior to being incarcerated. He is a tourist guide and he cheats his customers. Then comes his love affair with a dancer Rosie, who is married to Marco. Marco ridicules her dancing constantly. Rosie falls in love with Raju because he supports her passion and they live together, after which she becomes a star. Raju lives on her money and gets involved in a crime that leads to his imprisonment.  	One could empathise with Rosie whose passion is dancing, and who has the misfortune of falling in love with men who do not appreciate her. Despite leaving Marco for Raju and becoming famous, she still keeps the picture of her husband Marco in her wallet.  	Thus one can see that Raju, the central character in this novel, is a guide in several respects, a tourist guide, a guide to his lover's new career as a dancer, a guide to the inmates in the prison where he serves, and finally and most significantly, a spiritual guide.  	The use of shifting timeline as the scenes are presented back and forth makes up for the simple story. Narayan has superstitious beliefs and art as his side dishes.  	A 1958 novel, The Guide received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1960. The movie Guide took its adaptations from the novel and got released in 1965.  About R.K.Narayan  	Rasipuram Krishnaswami Iyer Narayanaswami is an Indian English author and a well-known novelist who belongs to the trio of Mulk Raj Anand and Raja Rao.  	His works include My Days, Swami and Friends, The Dark Room, Mr. Sampath, The English Teacher, The Vendor of Sweets, Waiting for The Mahatma, My Dateless Diary, and Malgudi Days.  	Narayan is a perfectionist while writing. With the simple presentation, a soul-stirring narration, and humour, a reader can find himself/herself transported to his fictional world.  	Born in Madras in the year 1906, R. K. Narayan had the nickname Kunjappa. His father was a school headmaster and Narayan studied there for a period of time.

He was presented with three Edgar Awards by the Mystery Writers of America for the collection Someone Like You, the story The Landlady, and Skin, in 1954, 1959, and 1980 respectively.

	Roald Dahl followed a very silly and creative style of writing and was known for his keen understanding of child psychology, which were reflected in his books. Through the course of his career, his work became more humorous, with macabre undertones, trespassing into subjects like murder, and bullying, while the more fantastical concepts took a backseat.

	Dahl did not go to university, preferring instead to start his career as an intelligence officer and flying ace with the British Royal Air Force in Nairobi, Kenya and wrote his autobiography Going Solo detailing his experiences in World War II. The socially vocal author was married twice – to Patricia Neal and Felicity Ann d’Abreu Crosland.

1197,Mansfield Park,"English, Paperback, Austen Jane",4.4,(268)," 	Mansfield Park, published in 1814, remains a unique novel in Jane Austen’s oeuvre. Markedly contrasting Pride and Prejudice, its immediate predecessor, Mansfield Park does not celebrate the traits of spiritedness, vivacity, celerity and lightness associating them with happiness and virtue, but rather praises social stasis. Lionel Trilling, in discussing the novel, examines this departure and observes, ‘It was Jane Austen who first represented the specifically modern personality and the culture in which it had its being. Never before had the moral life been shown as she shows it to be, never before had it been conceived to be so complex and difficult and exhausting….The sanctions upon which it relies are not those of culture, of quality of being, of personality but precisely those which the new conception of the moral life minimizes, the sanctions of principle, and it discovers in principle the path to the wholeness of the self which is peace when we have exhausted our anger at the offence which Mansfield Park offers to our conscious pieties, we find it possible to perceive how intimately it speaks to our secret in expressible hopes.’",₹133

About Roald Dahl

	Roald Dahl was a popular English author and has been named by The Times as one of ‘The 50 Greatest British Writers since 1945.’

	His first children’s book was The Gremlins, published in 1943. Since then, Dahl has created popular fiction for children including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and James and the Giant Peach, all of which have subsequently been adapted as movies. Dahl also enjoyed success as a writer of short stories for adults, usually with macabre and dark endings, in true Dahl style. He was presented with three Edgar Awards by the Mystery Writers of America for the collection Someone Like You, the story The Landlady, and Skin, in 1954, 1959, and 1980 respectively.

	Roald Dahl followed a very silly and creative style of writing and was known for his keen understanding of child psychology, which were reflected in his books. Through the course of his career, his work became more humorous, with macabre undertones, trespassing into subjects like murder, and bullying, while the more fantastical concepts took a backseat.

	Dahl did not go to university, preferring instead to start his career as an intelligence officer and flying ace with the British Royal Air Force in Nairobi, Kenya and wrote his autobiography Going Solo detailing his experiences in World War II. The socially vocal author was married twice – to Patricia Neal and Felicity Ann d’Abreu Crosland.
